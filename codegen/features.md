# programming language features
- parsing
- compilation
- syntax highlighting
- code completion
- linting
- incremental code generation
- static code analyzers
- code folding
- 

## todo
- master a template language
    - figure out how to write the template to be syntax-compatible with target language
        - this way you get all the useful lsp features and static checking

## learning
- codegen
    - caching strategies
    - incremental builds
    - parallel processing
- logging and analysis
    - how to analyize logs automatically for insights/issues
## ideas
- interpreter for intermediate representations
- vs compiler?

## questions
- diff between grammar and syntax
