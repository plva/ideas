- set up automated pipelines that respond to changes in your DSL scripts.
    - saving a file will trigger an event, where repo will be copied over to a new staging environment, everything automated will run, and will be able to see intermediate result (of code generation) before that code is run and tested.
    - to save time, the second step in the testing pipeline is run before the intermediate outputs are validated (manually), so that time is saved
- should have a single window that's uncategorized todos
